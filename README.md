# Todo-App

Todo-App is a React Native application for managing tasks and to-do lists. It allows users to create and delete tasks, as well as filter tasks based on completion. The app also allows users to register an account, storing their login data on local storage, and creating a user profile based on their information.

Features:
Create and delete tasks
Filter tasks by completion
Account registration & login
User profile

As the main contributor to this project, I set up the structure of the application through multiple stack navigators/screens. I implemented every screen along with the form validation for the user login/registration screens. I wrote the code that stores the personal information to local storage, then passes the information to their user profile through navigation parameters.
For the to-do list, I wrote the code that allows users to add tasks and delete tasks.
Specifically, I wrote the code for searching through the list of tasks based on completion and displaying the filtered results. Additionally, I helped with testing and debugging the app to ensure it was functioning correctly.
