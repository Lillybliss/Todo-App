# Todo-App

This project is a React Native mobile application that allows users to create a user profile for the to-do list application. The app includes features such as updating a user bio, creating and deleting tasks, and registering profiles using local storage.

The components implemented in this project include:

RegistrationScreen: form validation is used to create a user profile and save the login information on local storage. This information can then be used in the Login screen.
AccountScreen: creates a user profile based on the user information that is stored in local storage & passed to different components through navigation parameters.
UserBio: Allows the user to add and edit a bio on their profile.
toggleShowCompleted: A toggle button for the user to filter tasks based on completion.
